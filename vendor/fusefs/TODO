TODO for FuseFS
===============

- Fix rename when using raw_* functions. I've added raw_rename, but we need
  to add better solutions using raw_read and raw_write. Also when "renaming"
  an editor file.

For future consideration
========================

- Problem with editors: vim attempts to create and then delete a numbered file.
  This can be an issue if the filename (all digits) is reported as not valid.

  I am looking for a solution for this, but it's gonna be a pain.

- Tests, more tests, and unit tests!

- Consider FIFOs? We can use FIFOs to mimic TCP internet, if we do this right.
